# Timmy's Three Wishes


Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a yung boy named Tim. Tim lived in a smal village where he was known for his curios nature and love for adventur. One day, he decided to explore the mistical forest that lay beyond the village boundries.

As he walked through the dense forrest, he stumbled upon a strange looking creatur. It had big, floopy ears and a long, bushy tale. The creature looked at Tim and said, "Hello ther, human. My name is Fluffy, and I'm a magical rabit."

Tim was amazed to meet a talking rabbit. He replied, "Wow, I never seen anything like you before! What kind of magic can you do?"

Fluffy smiled and said, "I can grant you three wishes, but be carefull what you wish for. Magic is unpredicatable and can have unforseen consequenses."

Tim thought hard about his wishes. He said, "First, I wish for a never-ending suply of choclate. Second, I want to be the best futball player in the world. And third, I wish for peace and happyness for everyone in my villige."

Fluffy waved his paws and said, "Your wishes are granted, but remeber, magic comes with a price."

Tim thanked Fluffy and headed back home, excited to see his wishes come true. However, he soon realized that the never-ending chocolate was causing him to feel sick, being the best football player made him too busy to spend time with his frends, and the peace in the village was so quiet that it was actualy quite boring.

In the end, Tim learned that he should be careful what he wishes for and that the best things in life are the simple joys that come without magic.
